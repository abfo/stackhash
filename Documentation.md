# Installing StackHash

StackHash is a client/server application. The server is a Windows Service (the StackHash Service) and is configured by running the client on the same computer. For a client-only install select the _Advanced_ option during installation. StackHash includes full context sensitive help so after installation just hit F1 or select _Help_ from the _About_ menu to access product documentation.

The StackHash Client supports Windows XP SP3 or later with [.NET 4.0](http://www.microsoft.com/net/) installed. The StackHash Service must meet the following requirements:

* Windows Vista SP2, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 SP2 or Windows Server 2008 R2.
* [.NET 4.0](http://www.microsoft.com/net/).
* [Windows Live Sign-in Assistant](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=26686) (IMPORTANT - the link in the StackHash client is broken. Make sure you install this version of the Sign-in Assistant).
* SQL Server 2005 or 2008 (get [SQL Server 2008 R2 Express](http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/en/us/editions/express.aspx)).

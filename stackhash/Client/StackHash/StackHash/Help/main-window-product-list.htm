	        <h1>Main Window - Mapped Products</h1>

            <p>The mapped products view lists products mapped to your WinQual account for the current <a href="how-to-profiles.htm">profile</a>. 
            This is the default view when you run StackHash. You can return to this view at any time from View -> Home.</p> 

            <p>When you select a product the charts on the right will refresh to help you visualize the hits associated 
            with all events for that product. The charts are interactive &#8212; hover to see a tooltip with specific data, 
            double-click a chart element to search for events that match the highlighted data.</p>

            <p>The world map shows an approximate distribution of hits for the selected product. This chart is based 
            on the locale reported with each hit. Some countries use multiple locales and some countries do not have 
            an associated locale.</p>

            <p>Double click a product or click the <em>List Events</em> link to show the <a href="main-window-event-list.htm">Event List</a> view.</p>

            <p>A context menu is available when you right-click a mapped product. From this menu you can enable or 
            disable a product for synchronization, copy the <a href="how-to-stackhash-urls.htm">StackHash URL</a>, export information from the product to XML, set <a href="product-properties.htm">product properties</a> and open the product 
            page on the WinQual site.</p>

            <p>If no products are shown on this view check the following:</p>

            <ol>
            <li>StackHash allows you to hide products that are disabled for synchronization. You can toggle the visibility 
            of these products from the View menu.</li>

            <li>Refresh the current view: hit Ctrl-R, or View -> Refresh.</li>

            <li>Check that you are connected to the StackHash service and that an active profile is available in 
            Tools -> <a href="client-options.htm">Client Options</a> -> <a href="client-options-service-connection.htm">Service Connection</a>.</li>
            </ol>

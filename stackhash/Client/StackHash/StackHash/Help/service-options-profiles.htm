            <p><em>The service can only be configured by a client running on the same computer as the service.</em></p>

            <p>StackHash Profiles allow you to manage different WinQual accounts or to segment the information within an account. 
            See <a href="how-to-profiles.htm">Profiles</a> for more information.</p>

            <p>Active profiles will synchronize with WinQual according to the schedule configured in the profile. Click the 
            checkbox to activate or deactivate a profile. The StackHash client can only work with an active profile.</p>

            <p>To add a new profile click <em>Add</em>. To edit a profile double-click the profile in the list or select a profile 
            and click <em>Edit</em>. To remove a profile select it and then click <em>Delete</em>. Removing a profile does not delete any 
            of the information that has been downloaded. If you want to completely remove all data you must manually 
            delete the profile index folder.</p>

            <p>If a problem occurs loading a profile it will be deactivated and the status column will contain a brief error message. 
            Select the profile and click <em>Show Error</em> to view detailed information about the problem (and optionally to report 
            the problem to StackHash). The <em>Show Error</em> button is only present if one of your profiles has an error. After 
            correcting the error activate the profile by checking the Active checkbox to reload.</p>

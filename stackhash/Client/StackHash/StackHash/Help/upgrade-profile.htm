            <p>When upgrading to Beta 7 or later you will be prompted to upgrade your profile(s) 
            when StackHash loads.</p>

            <p>Prior to Beta 7 WinQual data was stored in XML files. From Beta 7 on StackHash stores 
            this information in a database (SQL Server 2005 or 2008).</p>

            <p>Downloaded cab files are still stored in a folder, however the directory structure has 
            changed to improve performance when a large number of cab files are present.</p>

            <p>Click each listed profile and then click the <em>Upgrade...</em> button. This will launch the 
            <a href="database-configuration.htm">Database Configuration Tool</a> which allows you to create a database and choose a 
            cab folder for the profile.</p>

            <p>If a profile is listed that you no longer need you can choose to delete it instead of upgrading 
            (select the profile and click the <em>Delete</em> button).</p>

            <p>If you do not already have SQL Server installed the Database Configuration Tool can 
            install SQL Server Express 2008 R2 with the <a href="how-to-getting-started.htm">recommended settings</a> for StackHash.</p>

            <p>Upgrading profiles is required to use Beta 7 or later. If you close the Upgrade Profile
             window before all profiles are upgraded StackHash will exit.</p>

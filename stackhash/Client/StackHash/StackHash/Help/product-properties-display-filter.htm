            <p>The display filter limits the number of events shown in the client. This is useful 
            if you have a very large number of events and wish to focus on those with the highest impact.</p>

            <p>If you set the hit threshold to 1,000 then only events with 1,000 or more hits will be 
            displayed in the client. Set the hit threshold to 0 to show all events.</p>

            <p>In addition to setting a display filter for a product you can also set a default display filter 
            in Tools -> <a href="client-options.htm">Client Options</a>. The default filter is used for products 
            that do not have a specific display filter set. </p>

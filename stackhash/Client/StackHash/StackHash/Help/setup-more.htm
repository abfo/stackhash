            <p>Click the <a href="client-options.htm">Client Options</a> and <a href="service-options.htm">Service Options</a> 
            links on this page to fine tune your StackHash installation.</p>

            <p>If you have a very large number of events consider setting a default display filter now. The 
            filter prevents the client from showing low hit count events. For example if you set the display 
            hit threshold to 1,000 then only events with 1,000 or more hits will be displayed in the client.
            Set the threshold to 0 to show all events.</p>

            <p>If Send anonymous statistics to StackHash is checked the StackHash service will report some 
            information to StackHash. This includes information about the number of different items synchronized 
            and any failures to load .NET components required for managed debugging from the Microsoft public 
            symbol server. This data helps us to improve the product. StackHash will never send crash details, 
            cabs, crash dumps or any information that could be used to identify your company, products or customers.</p>

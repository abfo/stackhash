	        <h1>StackHash FogBugz Plugin</h1>
            
            <p>Adds and updates FogBugz cases.</p>

            <p><strong>API URL</strong>: This is the URL of your FogBogz install with api.xml at the end, i.e. http://mycorp.fogbugz.com/api.xmi 
            or http://www.mycorp.com/fogbugz/api.xml.</p> 

            <p><strong>Username</strong>: FogBugz username (typically an email address). You can use your own 
            account or create a FogBugz user specifically for StackHash.</p>

            <p><strong>Password</strong>: Password for the FogBugz account.</p>

            <p><strong>Project</strong>: Project to add cases to. This is optional, if omitted cases will be added to the 
            default project. We recommend creating a project and area to use specifically for cases added by StackHash. 
            The project and area are set when the case is created but are not modified by updates so you can safely move 
            the case within FogBugz if necessary.</p>

            <p><strong>Area</strong>: Area to add cases to. This is optional, if omitted cases will be added to the 
            default area for the project.</p>

            <p><strong>Only add manually submitted events</strong>: Enter True to only create cases on demand. 
            To do this, right-click an event and choose <em>Send event to Plugin</em> -> <em>StackHash FogBugz Plugin</em>. 
            Enter False to automatically add new events during synchronization. Note, once an event has been added new notes, 
            cabs and script results will be added automatically.</p>

            <p><strong>Hit threshold for automatically adding events</strong>: Prevents events from being automatically 
            added unless the event has this number of hits. Enter 0 to add all events. Note this setting only applies 
            to events added during synchronization. Manually submitted events are always added.</p>

            <p>After adding this plugin you may wish to create FogBugz cases for existing events. To do this choose 
            <em>Synchronize with Plugins</em> from the <em>Tools</em> menu, check Synchronize for StackHash FogBugz 
            Plugin and click <em>OK</em>.</p>

            <p>The FogBugz plugin sets the Plugin Reference for events. This is included as a column in the 
            <a href="main-window-event-list.htm">event list</a> (scroll to the far right to find it, note 
            that you can drag columns to reorder). Only one plugin that sets the Plugin Reference can be active 
            in each <a href="how-to-profiles.htm">profile</a>.</p>

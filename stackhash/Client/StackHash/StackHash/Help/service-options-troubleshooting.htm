            <p><em>The service can only be configured by a client running on the same computer as the service.</em></p>

            <p>The StackHash service can write a troubleshooting log to the common application data directory. The default location for this log is:</p>

            <pre>C:\ProgramData\StackHash\StackHashServiceDiagnosticsLog.txt</pre>

            <p>In addition to the service log the StackHash client can be <a href="client-options-service-connection.htm">configured</a> to write a 
            log to your Desktop directory.</p>

            <p>If Send anonymous statistics to StackHash is checked the StackHash service will report some 
            information to StackHash. This includes information about the number of different items synchronized 
            and any failures to load .NET components required for managed debugging from the Microsoft public 
            symbol server. This data helps us to improve the product. StackHash will never send crash details, 
            cabs, crash dumps or any information that could be used to identify your company, products or customers.</p>

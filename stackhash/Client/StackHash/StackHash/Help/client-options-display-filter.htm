	        <h1>Client Options - Display Filter</h1>
            
            <p>The display filter limits the number of events shown in the client. This is useful 
            if you have a very large number of events and wish to focus on those with the highest impact.</p>

            <p>If you set the hit threshold to 1,000 then only events with 1,000 or more hits will be 
            displayed in the client. Set the hit threshold to 0 to show all events.</p>

            <p>In addition to setting the default display filter in Client Options you can override this 
            setting for each product. Right click the product and chose <em>Properties</em> to set a different 
            display filter for a single product.</p>

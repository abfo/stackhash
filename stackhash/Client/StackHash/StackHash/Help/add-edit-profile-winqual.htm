	        <h1>Add/Edit Profile - WinQual</h1>

            <p>The profile name is used to identify this <a href="how-to-profiles.htm">profile</a>. We recommend using your company or product name. 
            You cannot use a profile name that is already in use by another profile.</p>

            <h2>WinQual Credentials</h2>

            <p>Enter your WinQual username and password. Click the Test button to ensure that StackHash can access 
            WinQual using your credentials. If the test fails check that you have entered your credentials correctly 
            and try again. Also try logging in at winqual.microsoft.com.</p>

            <h2>Cab Folder and Database Settings</h2>

            <p>Click <em>Move or Edit Database</em> to run the <a href="database-configuration.htm">StackHash Database 
            Configuration Tool</a>. This will allow you to move your database and/or the contents of the cab folder. Note 
            that moving to a new database can take a long time as each record is validated during the move.</p>

            <p><em>Cab Folder</em> and <em>Connection String</em> show the current name 
            and location of the profile cab folder and database. Click <em>Test</em> 
            to check that the StackHash Service can connect to the database.</p>

            <p>The purge setting is the age of cab files that should automatically be removed in days. The default 
            value of 180 will delete cab files and any extracted crash dumps from the index folder after six months. 
            You should set this to comply with the data retention rules in your current WinQual agreement with Microsoft.</p>

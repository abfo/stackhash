            <p>If you installed the StackHash client and service on the same computer the default host and port do not need to be changed. 
            If the service is running on a different computer you must enter the host (network name or IP address) and port to connect with. 
            If you are not sure what to enter check with the person responsible for administering your StackHash server.</p>

            <p>The list of <a href="how-to-profiles.htm">Profiles</a> may be empty if you are not connected to the StackHash service or there are no active profiles 
            available. Click the <a href="service-options.htm"><em>Service Options</em></a> button to fix this (<em>Note: The service can only be 
            configured by a client running on the same computer as the service.</em>)</p>

            <p>Click the <a href="service-credentials.htm"><em>Service Credentials</em></a> link to specify the account to use when connecting to the 
            StackHash Service. By default your current Windows credentials are used.</p>

            <p>If you change the service host and/or port the profile list is cleared. Click Refresh to update the list with available active profiles.</p>

            <p>StackHash can write a troubleshooting log to your desktop directory. In addition to the client log, on the Service Connection 
            tab you can also <a href="service-options-troubleshooting.htm">enable logging</a> for the service.</p>

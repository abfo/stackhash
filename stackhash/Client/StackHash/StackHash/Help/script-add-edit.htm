	        <h1>Add/Edit Script</h1>
            
            <p>See <a href="how-to-scripting.htm">Scripting</a> for help on writing StackHash Scripts.</p>

            <p>You must enter a name for the script. You can rename an existing script by changing the name 
            and clicking OK.</p>

            <p>Scripts can selectively be run on managed or native dumps (a dump is treated as managed if 
            the .NET CLR has been loaded). The default is to run scripts on all crash dumps.</p>

            <p>If <em>Run on cabs automatically</em> is checked this script will be run immediately after each 
            synchronization with WinQual. The script will be run on all new cabs and also any existing 
            cabs that do not already have results for this script.</p>

            <p>An optional comment can be added to each line of the script using the * character, i.e.:</p>

            <pre>.kp * Print Stack</pre>

            <p>Only the last * is treated as a comment so for commands that include the * character a comment is required, i.e.:</p>

            <pre>.shell dir *.dll * Comment is required</pre>

            <p>Comments are not permitted for the .sympath, .srcpath and .exepath commands. Any comment added 
            following these commands will be treated as part of the script line.</p>

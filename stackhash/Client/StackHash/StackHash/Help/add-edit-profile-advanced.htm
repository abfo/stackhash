            <h2>WinQual API</h2>

            <p>These settings allow you to fine tune how StackHash works with the WinQual API.</p>

            <p><strong>Timeout</strong> sets the number of minutes to wait for a response from WinQual.</p>

            <p><strong>Cab download failure limit</strong> controls how many failed downloads can occur before a synchronization attempt will be abandoned.</p>

            <p><strong>Per-request retries</strong> is the number of times StackHash will retry a failed request before a synchronization attempt will be abandoned.</p>

            <p><strong>Syncs before automatic resync</strong> triggers a full resynchronization with WinQual after the specified number of normal 
            synchronizations. During a normal sync StackHash adds events, hits and cabs that have been added to WinQual since the last sync completed. 
            Resynchronization processes all events, hits and cabs and can pick up data that may have been missed during the last sync. Setting this 
            value to 1 will force StackHash to always resynchronize. </p>

            <p>Check <em>Retry after failed synchronization</em> to schedule another attempt after the number of minutes specified in <strong>Delay before retry</strong> below.</p>

            <p>Check <em>Enable sync for new product mappings</em> to automatically start synchronizing new products. If unchecked you must 
            manually right-click each new product and choose Enable Synchronization.</p>

            <p>Checking Force update of all script results will cause each script that is <a href="script-add-edit.htm">set to run automatically</a> 
            to run again on each cab that has been downloaded. This setting will affect the next sync only and will be reset once all scripts have been 
            run again. The default is to only run scripts if a result for a cab is not present and the script has not changed since the result was added.</p>

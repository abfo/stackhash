	        <h1>Service Credentials</h1>
            
            <p>If you are connecting to the StackHash Service on a remote computer you can specify the 
            credentials to use in this window.</p>

            <p>Enter the username and password of the user to connect as and optionally the domain. 
            Leave all three fields blank to connect using your current credentials.</p>

            <p>Specifying credentials is most useful when running StackHash in a workgroup. By default 
            your username and password must match an account that exists on the service computer. It 
            may be more convenient to create a single account for StackHash access and then use these 
            credentials to authenticate each StackHash client instance.</p>

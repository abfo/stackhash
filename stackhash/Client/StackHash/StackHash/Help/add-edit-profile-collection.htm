	        <h1>Add/Edit Profile - Default Collection Policy</h1>

            <p>The profile collection policy applies to all products and events that do not have an individual collection policy. 
            You can set the policy in the product and event lists by right-clicking an item and choosing <em>Properties</em> from the context menu.</p>

            <h2>Cab Collection Policy</h2>

            <p>You can choose to download all cabs, a number of cabs, a percentage of cabs or not to download cabs at all. 
            Note that the StackHash policy does not affect the number of cabs collected by WinQual. If you need more cabs 
            for an event you must login to the WinQual site and request additional cabs.</p>

            <p>If you limit cab collection to a number or percentage you can choose how StackHash prioritizes which of the 
            available cabs to download. In most cases you'll get the best result by choosing to download the largest cabs first.</p>

            <p>If <em>Download larger cabs</em> is checked StackHash will exceed the download limit if a larger cab is 
            available through WinQual. This is useful if the first few cabs collected for a new event don't contain much 
            information and then a large cab (say including heap data) is added after your download limit has been reached.</p>

            <h2>Event Collection Policy</h2>

            <p>The event policy allows you to not download cabs at all for events with a low hit count. For example if you 
            set this to 100 then cabs will only be downloaded for events with 100 or more hits. If you set the threshold 
            to 0 then cabs will be downloaded according to the cab collection policy for all events. </p>

            <p>Note that the event policy takes precedence over the cab policy. If an event has fewer hits than the threshold 
            then no cabs are downloaded regardless of the cab collection settings.</p>

	        <h1>Event Properties - Collection Policy</h1>

            <p>The event collection policy allows you to set a specific cab collection policy for an event.</p>

            <p>If an event collection policy is not set then the product collection policy for the associated product is used. 
            If the product does not have a specific collection policy then the default collection policy for the 
            <a href="how-to-profiles.htm">profile</a> is used.</p>

            <h2>Cab Collection Policy</h2>

            <p>You can choose to download all cabs, a number of cabs, a percentage of cabs or not to download cabs at all. 
            Note that the StackHash policy does not affect the number of cabs collected by WinQual. If you need more cabs 
            for an event you must login to the WinQual site and request additional cabs.</p>

            <p>If you limit cab collection to a number or percentage you can choose how StackHash prioritizes which of the 
            available cabs to download. In most cases you'll get the best result by choosing to download the largest cabs first.</p>

            <p>If <em>Download larger cabs</em> is checked StackHash will exceed the download limit if a larger cab is 
            available through WinQual. This is useful if the first few cabs collected for a new event don't contain much 
            information and then a large cab (say including heap data) is added after your download limit has been reached.</p>

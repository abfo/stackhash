            <p>StackHash profiles allow you to work with different WinQual accounts or to show 
            information from the same account in different ways.</p>

            <p>The StackHash service can manage many different profiles, including synchronizing 
            each profile with WinQual using the specified schedule. The StackHash client can only 
            work with one profile at a time. You can change the current profile in Tools -> 
            <a href="client-options.htm">Client Options</a> -> <a href="client-options-service-connection.htm">Service Connection</a>.</p>

            <p>When you run the <a href="setup.htm">Setup Wizard</a> StackHash guides you through 
            creating your first profile. In many cases a single profile will be sufficient. You can 
            add, edit and remove profiles from Tools -> <a href="service-options.htm">Service Options</a> -> 
            <a href="service-options-profiles.htm">Profiles</a>. This option is only available when 
            running the client on the same computer as the service.</p>

            <p>Each profile must have a unique profile name and local store index name. Profiles cannot 
            share data. If you configure more than one profile to synchronize the same mapped products 
            from the same WinQual account you will duplicate data.</p>

            <p>It can make sense to use several profiles for the same WinQual account if you want to 
            separate out different products. If your account contains products A, B and C you might 
            set up a profile for each product and enable the versions of that product for synchronization. 
            Each product team can then configure the StackHash client to use the profile associated with 
            their product.</p>

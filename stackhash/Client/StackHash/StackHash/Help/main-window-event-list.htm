	        <h1>Main Window - Event List</h1>

            <p>The event list shows events for the selected product or search. The breadcrumbs at the top left of the view show the 
            product name and version for a product event list and &lsquo;Search Results&rsquo; for a search. To clear a search click 
            the clear search toolbar button or delete all text from the search box and hit enter.</p>

            <p>You can enter a bug tracking number or other brief information about the event in the Reference column. Click the 
            reference cell for an event, type your reference and then hit enter to save.</p>

            <p>The summary at the top right displays information about the selected product. If the summary contains no information 
            then the event list contains the results of a search across all products.</p>

            <p>When you select an event the charts on the right will refresh to help you visualize the hits associated with that 
            event. The charts are interactive &#8212; hover to see a tooltip with specific data, double-click a chart element to search 
            for events that match the highlighted data.</p>

            <p>Double-click an event or click <em>Show Details</em> to show the <a href="main-window-event-details.htm">Event Details</a> view.</p>

            <p>A context menu is available when you right-click an event. From this menu you can open the event page on the WinQual 
            site, copy the <a href="how-to-stackhash-urls.htm">StackHash URL</a>, export information to XML, set <a href="event-properties.htm"> event properties</a> and search for more information 
            about the application or module associated with the event.</p>
